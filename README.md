## üìã Overview

This MQL5 Expert Advisor implements a High Low Breakout trading strategy that identifies and trades based on significant support and resistance levels. The algorithm analyzes historical price data within a specified lookback period to detect high and low touch points, creating trading opportunities when price breaks through these established levels.

### How It Works

1. **Level Detection**: The algorithm scans the last X candles (configurable via input parameter) to identify significant highs and lows
2. **Confirmation Logic**: It counts the number of touches on potential support/resistance levels
3. **Signal Generation**: Once the required number of touches is confirmed (also configurable), a horizontal line is drawn on the chart
4. **Trade Execution**: When price breaks through the confirmed level, a buy or sell order is executed automatically
5. **Risk Management**: The EA includes comprehensive risk management features including trailing stops, breakeven functionality, and drawdown protection
